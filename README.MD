## 🛠️ Technology

Runway is powered by [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/), the same technology behind [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/). WebContainers provide a browser-based runtime for executing Node.js applications and operating system commands entirely within your browser tab, eliminating the need for cloud VMs and offering improved performance and security.

The project is built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api](https://github.com/CodinGame/monaco-vscode-api), and [zen-fs](https://github.com/zen-fs/core) (don't look at the [package.json](https://github.com/Badbird5907/runway/blob/master/package.json))
